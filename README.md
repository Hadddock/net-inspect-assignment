# Net Inspect Assignment
## Overview
* The final project runs through App.js which includes PaginatedTable as a child component. I designed PaginatedTable to be as independent as possible, receiving parameters from its parents for details about how to be displayed (which columns to exclude, order of columns, name remappings)
* Made with React
* Complete Unit Test suite for PaginatedTable component
* BEM organized SCSS
* Live deployment: https://hadddock.github.io/net-inspect-assignment/
* Live deployment just loads the json data from a file (sorry Heroku, I'm keeping my $5)
